# Hotness

I live in the terminal, and I wanted a good theme for a dark background. I 
don't like most of the default themes. So I decided to create my own. The name 
partially comes from the fact that I use Hot Pink as a main color. I also 
thought it would be funny to be able to answer the question: "What's your Vim theme?" 
with "I use the Hotness"
