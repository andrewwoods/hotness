# Hotness

I live in the terminal, and I wanted a good theme for a dark background. I 
don't like most of the default themes. So I decided to create my own. The name 
partially comes from the fact that I use Hot Pink as a main color. I also 
thought it would be funny to be able to answer the question: "What's your Vim 
theme?" with "I use the Hotness"

## Install

* Download the .zip of this repo and unzip it
* Copy colors/hotness.vim to your ~/.vim/colors directory 
* in your ~/.vimrc file, add the following lines 

```
set background=dark

" Turns on syntax highlighting.
syntax on

" Current Theme
colorscheme hotness

" Highlight the current line
set cursorline
```

Now you're all set to apply the Hotness to your code!
